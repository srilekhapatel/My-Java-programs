Simple Encoded Array:
=========================
Maya has stored few confidential numbers in an array(array of int).
To ensure that others do not find the numbers easly, she has applied
a simple encoding.

Encoding used: Each array element has been substituted with a value 
that is the sum of it's original value and its succeeding element's value

l.e. arr[i]= original value of arr[i] original value of ani+ 1

ex: arr[0] = original value of arr[0] + original value of arr[1]

Also note that value of last element Le arflast index) remains unchanged.

For example,
If the encoded array is (7, 6, 8, 16, 12, 3)
The Original array should have been (2, 5, 1, 7, 9,3)

Provided the encoded array, you are expected to find the
a. First number (value in index O) in the original array
b. Sum of all numbers in the original array

Input: n. length of array and integer array
Output: integer at index O of original array, sum of all the elements 
of original array.

Sample input:
6
7 6 8 16 12 3

Sample output:
2
27

Explanation:
If the encoded array is [7, 6, 8, 16, 12, 3)
The Original array should have been (2, 5,1,7,9,3)
Element at index(0) is 2
sum of all the elements in the original array 2+5+1+7+9+3 = 27

SOLUTION:
============
import java.util.Scanner;
class TestClass {
	public static void main(String args() ) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		int[] a=new int[n];
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
			a[i]=sc.nextInt();
		}
		int[] res=new int[n];
		res[res.length-1]=a[n-1];
		for(int i=n-1;i>0;i--){
			res[i-1]=a[i-1]-res[i];
		}
		int sum=0;
		for(int item:res){
			sum+=item;
		}
		System.out.print(res[0]+" "+sum);
	}
}
