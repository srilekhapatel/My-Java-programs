A child care NGO:
===================
A childcare NGO WeCare can receive N number of applications every year. 
Out of these applications, some are from volunteers who wish to work for
the NGO full time and some applications are for interns. Each application
received by the NGO has an application ID from a-z and A-Z. The volunteer
applications are (a,e,i,o,u, A,E,I,O, U) while the rest are the intern
application IDs The NGO wishes to know the count of intern applications in
the given list of N currently received application IDs.
Write an algorithm to help the NGO determine the total count of intern application IDs.

Sample input:
6
avikel

Sample Output:
3

Explanation:
Input:
The first line of the input consists of an integer numOfapplications representing the number of currently received applications (N).
The second line consists of N space-separated characters-applicationID-1, applicationID-2, and so on representing the application IDs of the N applications.
  
Output:
Print an integer representing the number of intern application ID's among the given applications.

Solution:
===============
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.lang.String;
class TestClass {
	public static void main(String args() ) throws Exception {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int n=sc.nextInt();
		String str=sc.next();
		str=str.toLowerCase();
		int vcount=0,ccount=0;
		for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++){
			char ch=str.charAt(i);
			if(ch=='a' || ch=='e' || ch=='i' || ch=='o' || ch=='u' ||
			ch== 'A' || ch=='E' || ch=='I' || ch=='O' || ch=='U'){
				vcount++;
			}
			else{
				ccount++;
			}
		}
		System.out.print(ccount);
	}
}
